## Task1: Citibike Hypothesis Testing Review
### Create a pull request to provide some suggestions on my classmate Rufei Sheng(rs6431)'s Citibike project assignment. The pull request contains a CitibikeReview_ab8131.md. In this markdown profile, I provide some advice on code, statistical test method in the next step, and suggestions to improve variables.

## Assignment 2
Group work with Asilayi Bahetibieke(ab8131), I did the ANOVA test and Correlation test while Asilayi finished the Logistic Regression test.
### ANOVA
| Statistical Analyses  | IV(s) | IV type(s) | DV(s) | DV type(s) | Control Var | Control Var type | Question to be answered | H0 | alpha | link to paper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ANOVA  | 3, Player Level, (Professional level, Semi-profesisonal level, Non-professional level)  | Categorical  | 1, Motor Test  | Continuous  | None  | None  | Is the prognostic relevance of motor prognostic valid for identifying talents for potential players  | Players who reached APL1 had better scores in all motor test than the players who made it to the semi-professional or non-professional level  | 0.05  | [The influence of speed abilities and technical skills in early adolescence on adult success in soccer: A long-term prospective analysis using ANOVA and SEM approaches](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182211)  |

### Task3: Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY
### By Hypothesis testing, I figured out whether the program has influence on participants' employment and the percentage of being convicted of a felony in the Recidivism (Years 1-3) after release. The method including Z-test and Chi-Sqaure test.
