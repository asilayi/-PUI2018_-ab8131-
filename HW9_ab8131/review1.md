## Clarity:
#### This plot has a clear color transition and easy to understand. However, the xlabel, ylabel index number and notes are a little bit small and hard to see.

## Esthetic:
#### The colors and linewidth picked are appropriate and easy to distinguish. However, the fontsize of the notes is too small to see.

## Honestly:
#### The plot honestly reflect what the data mean to tell.
