## Clarity:
#### Generally speaking, the plot is very easy to understand with the clear color transition. However, I suggest adding a colorbar at the upper left corner so that the reader could immediately realize the corresponding density percentage of each color. Besides, I'm very confused about the scale on X and Y axis. More details like labels are needed for the two axis so that readers could understand what those large numbers mean.

## Esthetic:
#### Esthetically this is well plotted, the colors picked are appropriate and easy to distinguish; the linewidth between each district is perfect. However, the fontsize of the title is too small to see. I didn't even realize there is a title when I first look at it. Also, when the labels on X and Y axis are added, attension should be paid on the fontsize of the labels to make the whole plot look more naturally.

## Honestly:
#### The plot honestly reflect what the data mean to tell.
