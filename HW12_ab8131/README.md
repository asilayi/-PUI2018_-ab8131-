I worked with Jingtian Zhou(jz3525)  By following the notebook instructions, I downloaded and preprocessed the dataset, and Zhou trained the KMeans model with n = 5,6,7 seperately with that data, plotted the time series clusters and showed the training labels on the map. Besides, Zhou also trained the dataset with Agglomerative Clustering model with n = 7, plotted the result and plotted the dandrogram graph.
